# MathSpeech
A splinter project from PythonSpeechRecognition, this is an attempt to use speech recognition(in python) to solve math problems spoken normally(As one would normally say the problem).
##Setup
Speech recognition is done through a python library, found here: [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/). Make sure to install.
##Use
In order to use/test the program, just run the main.py file and when it outputs "Input equation:" say your equation. It should then output what it thought you said, the mathematical equivalent, and the result.
